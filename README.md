# README

This repository has all the code necessary for starting a React on Rails application
including testing. To get started, just clone the repository down and get started using
React on Rails like you normally would.

## Areas in the Boilerplate to Update
Be sure to search `boilerplate` within your project and update any references to
boilerplate with the name of your application. If you do not follow this step, your
application may not behave the way that you expect it to.

## Ideas for Getting Started
Potential places to start for a side project:
* Find an API that interests you and display the information in an interesting way
* Make a clone of a website that already exists
* Make a game that users can play on a website
* Extend an assignment that you've already done to add additional features

No idea is too small, weird or insignificant to get started with. If you're interested
in the project, you'll keep working on it and learn a lot about coding. Download the
boilerplate, make those first commits and enjoy!
